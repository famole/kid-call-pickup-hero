# 👋 Welcome to Upsy Documentation Hub

### What is Upsy?

**Upsy** is a web and mobile platform that transforms the student pick-up experience at schools. It’s designed to simplify, organize, and secure the daily dismissal process by connecting parents, teachers, and administrators in a fast, modern, and user-friendly system.

> **Our mission** is to eliminate long queues, waiting times, and confusion at school gates. With just one tap, parents notify their arrival, teachers manage the student flow in real time, and school administrators have full visibility and control over the entire process.
