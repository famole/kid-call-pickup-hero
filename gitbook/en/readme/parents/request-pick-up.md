## 🕒 When should I request pick-up?

It's important to note that once a pick-up is requested, the teacher will begin preparing the student to leave.\
For this reason, **you should avoid sending a pick-up request before you’ve arrived at school**.

✅ You can request pick-up:

* Once you arrive at school.
* From the parking or pick-up area.
