# 🔑 Sign Up

## 🔐 First-time Login

### 🔵 Option 1: Sign in with Google

* Click the **"Sign in with Google"** button.
* Select your Google account.
* That’s it! No need to create or remember a password.

✅ This is the simplest and fastest option if your email is a Gmail address or linked to Google.

***

### 🟡 Option 2: Use a different email (non-Google)

* On the login screen, click **“Set up your account”**.
* Enter your email address.
* If your email was preloaded by the school, the system will allow you to create a password.
* Once you set your password, you can log in using your email and password from now on.

📝 This process only needs to be done once. After that, you’ll log in normally with your credentials.
